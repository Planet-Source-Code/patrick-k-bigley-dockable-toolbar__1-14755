## Dockable Toolbar


</div>

### Description

Professional High Quality Code. Looks, works and behaves like the Windows Task/Icon bar on your screen (only better, with more properties). It actually forces the screen size to a slightly smaller size to fit the toolbar in place, thus the user still has full view of other software programs running at the same time. This is the genuine untouched code "...based on the J.Richter's CAppBar...", (FREEWARE)! Use it for many projects. No need to buy or use a TOOLBAR OCX. A few lines of code is all you need, when you add the prewritten BAS and CLS files.

Creat your own BANNER style form, like the ones seen with FREE INTERNET servers. This code is genius!
